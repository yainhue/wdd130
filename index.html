        <h2>Argentina, Buenos Aires</h2>
        <img src="./images/buenos-aires.jpg" alt="Ciudad Autonoma de Buenos Aires">
        <p>Buenos Aires, officially the Buenos Aires Province, is the largest and most populous Argentine province. It
            takes its
            name from the city of Buenos Aires, the capital of the country, which used to be part of the province and
            its capital
            until it was federalized in 1880. Since then, despite bearing the same name, the province does not include
            Buenos Aires
            city, though it does include all other parts of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan region, which contain
            approximately three-fourths of the conurbation's population. The capital of the province is the city of La
            Plata,
            founded in 1882.</p>
